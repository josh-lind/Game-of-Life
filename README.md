This repository contains a program that runs an implementation of John Conway's Game of Life. 
The game of life is intended to simulate the birth and death of cells in a society. 
Graphics2D is used to display the game.
Also, GameOfLife.java has four final variables at the top (ROW, COL, MIN_FOR_DEAD_START, SLEEPTIME)
which can be used to set the corresponding variables.
